# Set PATH #

Set your PATH environment variable so that the operating ststem can find the osgBullet binary files. This is the install location, such as /usr/local/bin or C:\Program Files\osgBullet\bin.

# Set OSG\_FILE\_PATH #

Set your OSG\_FILE\_PATH environment variable so that OSG and osgBullet can find the osgBullet "data" directory. The path will depend on the location of your osgBullet source tree.

# Dependencies #

PATH and OSG\_FILE\_PATH should also be configured as necessary for the OSG, Bullet, and osgWorks dependencies. See their project pages for additional information.
